  Hi, I’m **Anish** — I’m pursuing a degree in Statistics & Data Science at UT Austin. I love thinking analytically and using numbers/probability to approach any problem in life. I have been styduing for data science interview in my free time brushing up on topics like pandas and numpy. Also in my free time I watch sports, play sports, and play video games

## A few things I enjoy
